/* Holds a Cube's worth of LEDs along with various way to manipulate the

 * Once an arrangement is set, generate a sequence of steps required to
 * display the cube arrangement with the set of decoders available,
 * then output that sequence.
 *
 * Depending on the pattern different sequences are more optimal.
 * Currently this is optimized for the same pattern on different layers,
 * so as to enable all layers, then cycle one decoder through all the
 * patterns before going on to the next layer or decoder.  This can have
 * up to five LEDs on at a time.
 * Alternatively one layer could be enabled, update all decoders to the
 * first LED for that layer, delay, go on to the next LED, and then
 * the next layer.  This can have up to 4 LEDs on at one time, although
 * as one LED is directly connected to a pin it will mostly only have
 * three LEDs on at one time.
 * Depending on the pattern more symmetry could be found with up to 20
 * LEDs on at a time.
